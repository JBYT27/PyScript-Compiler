# PyScript
##### The Unoffical and Offical Language coded by @JBYT27
###### View the `githubREADME.md` if you are viewing this on GITHUB.

## About the language
#### PyScript is a PL *(programming language)*; `Python` combined with `JavaScript`. The syntax is a bit wobbled up, but it's basically `JavaScript` syntax and `Python` syntax mashed together. Like I said, it's wobbled up because they don't really fit, __`whitespace`__ *vs* __`brackets`__. For more info about the syntax, you can visit the docs (below). The language is meant to be a scripting language combined with a bit of `OOP`* Language as well. So it's mostly a `Scripting` Language, bit then again, it can be used as an `OOP` Language. 

## Using the PL
#### To use it, please either fork the repl, or fork the repo, either one works! :)
